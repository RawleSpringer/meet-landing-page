## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

The biggest thing i have learned through out all of this is that learning is best done by simply building projects. For so long i was obsessed with having to know everything before i would complete a project. So, I would take tutorial after to tutorial. Anytime i would encounter a road block i would stop building and go back to tutorials.

This resulted in me being stuck in tutorial hell for 3 years. Its not going to be perfect but the most important thing is to get it done.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

The areas i would love to focus on is CSS. It is by far my weakest area. I want to particuarly better my competency in responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [CSS for Javascript Developers](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js) - This helped me with my fear of CSS and gave me priceless gems that helped me to work through some obstacles i encountered during the building of this challenge
